# OMX Sysex spec

The OMX-27 interfaces with its editor via MIDI Sysex. This document describes the supported messages.

_Work in progress, porting from 16n faderbank editor_

## `0x1F` - "1nFo"

Request for OMX-27 to transmit current state via sysex. No other payload.

## `0x0F` - "c0nFig"

"Here is my current config." Only sent by OMX-27 as an outbound message, in response to `0x1F`. Payload of 32 bytes, describing current EEPROM state.

## `0x0E` - "c0nfig Edit"

~~"Here is a new complete configuration for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 80 bytes to go straight into EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.~~ not implemented

## `0x0D` - "c0nfig edit (Device options)"

"Here is a new set of device options for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 32 bytes to go straight into appropriate locations of EEPROM, according to the following map:
```
	//  64 bytes of data:
	//  0 - EEPROM VERSION
	//  1 - Current MODE
	//  2 - Sequencer PlayingPattern
	//  3 - MIDI mode MidiChannel 
	//  4 - 28 - Pots (x25 - 5 banks of 5 pots)
	//  29 - MIDI Macro Channel
	//  30 - MIDI Macro Type
	//  31 - Scale Root
	//  32 - Scale Pattern, -1 for chromatic
	//  33 - Lock Scale - Bool
	//  34 - Scale Group 16 - Bool
	//  35 - midiSettings.defaultVelocity
	//  36 - clockConfig.globalQuantizeStepIndex
	//  37 - cvNoteUtil.triggerMode
	// 	38 - actvie pot bank
	
	//  XX - 63 - Not yet used

```

`F0 7D 00 00 0D 09 00 00 00 15 16 17 18 07 1D 1E 1F 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 5B 5D 67 68 69 00 00 00 F7`

## `0x0C` - "c0nfig edit (usb options)"

~~"Here is a new set of USB options for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 32 bytes to go straight into appropriate locations of EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.~~ not implemented

## `0x0B` - "c0nfig edit (trs options)"

~~"Here is a new set of TRS options for you". Payload (other than mfg header, top/tail, etc) of 32 bytes to go straight into appropriate locations of EEPROM, according to the memory map described in `README.md`.~~ not implemented
