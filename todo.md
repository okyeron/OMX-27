# TO-DO 

## j__r0d's shortlist

- move files to subfolders
- update includes
- move consts to appropriate files in consts subfolder
- second pass move

## original to-do below

- Pattern saving w/ FRAM
- Reset copiedFlag/clearedFlag/pastedFlag after some timeout
- Play direction
- Additional mode for MIDI settings (channel, etc)?
- Change MIDI channel per pattern  
- UI
- Copy note to other steps - or assign same note to all steps?
- Panic/all-notes-off on AUX?
- what happens on CV when you have multiple keys pressed?

## NEEDS MORE TESTING

- Step recording (needs testing)
- transpose entire sequence (needs testing)
- Conditional triggers (see grid step on norns )

## BUGS

- Pattern params - pattern length leds not set to correct seq-page
- step record skipping steps - sometimes led stays on ??
- CV sequence running all day and twice, the sequencer just paused for awhile and then started up again

## IDEAS / FEATURE REQUESTS / WISH LIST

- chain patterns?
- Record CC automation (playback on clock ticks)
- supersteps ( lfo waveforms per step for CCs - with a bunch of preset waveforms?)
- randomize function (Random Patterns?)
- quantization for the live playing.
- quantize record 
- Arps
- midi delay?
- controllable sequence drift?. P1: probability of step drift, P2: direction and distance, P3: velocity, P4: set of quantizations.
- CV mode - like a single channel version of a 0-control? maybe presets on the "white" keys and LFO's on the "black"
