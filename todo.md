# TO-DO 

* Pattern saving w/ FRAM

* Reset copiedFlag/clearedFlag/pastedFlag after some timeout

* Play direction

* Additional mode for MIDI settings (channel, etc)?

* Change MIDI channel per pattern  

* UI

* Copy note to other steps - or assign same note to all steps?

* Panic/all-notes-off on AUX?

* what happens on CV when you have multiple keys pressed?


# NEEDS MORE TESTING

* Step recording (needs testing)
 
* transpose entire sequence (needs testing)

* Conditional triggers (see grid step on norns )


# BUGS

* Pattern params - pattern length leds not set to correct seq-page

* step record skipping steps - sometimes led stays on ??

* CV sequence running all day and twice, the sequencer just paused for awhile and then started up again


# IDEAS / FEATURE REQUESTS / WISH LIST

* chain patterns?

* Record CC automation (playback on clock ticks)

* supersteps ( lfo waveforms per step for CCs - with a bunch of preset waveforms?)

* randomize function (Random Patterns?)

* quantization for the live playing.

* quantize record 

* Arps

* midi delay?

* controllable sequence drift?. P1: probability of step drift, P2: direction and distance, P3: velocity, P4: set of quantizations.

* CV mode - like a single channel version of a 0-control? maybe presets on the "white" keys and LFO's on the "black"
